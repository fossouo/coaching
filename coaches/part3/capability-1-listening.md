# Listening

Just as we advise our coaches to be strong listeners, your tech lead should be a strong listener as well. 

Communication is said to be the hallmark of leadership, and communication has many aspects to it, including speaking and listening. But listening is the most important of the two components because it is through listening that a tech lead is able to gather the raw material he or she needs to take action.

We cannot overemphasize this skill enough because it is the foundation of all leadership activites that follow. 

So many tech leads (and other leaders, for that matter) get hung up on making right choices or go out and execute on the wrong path. Most of these anxieties or errors could be solved if the tech lead had better information. And the only way to get that information is for the tech lead to listen carefully to what their engineers, their other team members, and their management is saying. 

#### The Listening Maturity Scale - Stacking

The scale for this skill is a stacking scale, which is to say that each skill builds on the next.

At the **beginner** level, tech leads tend to focus primarily on the content of what others say. For example, the tech lead may only recall facts, figures, data provided by others. There is nothing wrong with starting at this level because it is obviously important to remember exactly the words or data being transmitted by others. Indeed, some tech leads struggle even at this level either because they either (1) do not solicit information or data from others or (2) when they do receive data or information they disregard, ignore, or forget it. 

At the **intermediate** level, tech leads are able to not only receive facts and data but are able to have a stronger comprehension and memory of the nuances of the context of communication as well some of the non-verbal signals such as body language. Attaining this level is difficult for almost everyone, but it is a powerful skill for leads.

At the **advanced** level, we challenge tech leads to listen at the level that you we advise to start at with coaching (which is part of why we believe learning to be an effective coach could be so impactful for your own leadership). Recall that the definition of "empathic" listening is actually pretty simple, despite the fact that all humans struggle with it. For the tech lead to reach this advanced maturity they need to be able to hear what others say and put their own needs aside for a moment. 

For example, in the advanced level, the tech lead may be communicating with another engineer on the team. He or she is able to read the context and non-verabl signal with skill but to be empathic, the tech lead needs to not let his or her needs. Those needs may include:
1. Concerns about his or her capabilities as a lead
2. Concerns about deadlines or pressures
3. Irritations about what the other person is saying
4. Needing the other person to do something they are not doing

The list of possible distractions is endless but the effect is the same. The tech lead cannot truly hear what the other person is saying if the tech lead's needs are more important to him or her than what the other person is saying. And the same is true for you as a coach.

#### How To Explore Listening in Your Coaching

As we said, this a **crucial** skill to test your tech lead on. Here are some tips on how to explore it:

1. If he or she is struggling with something, ask what information he or she is using and where he or she got it.
2. If it was through listening, challenge the tech lead to push through the content of what he or she heard to what was actually said by others. 
3. Ask them to see how clearly they understood the context of the communication. 
4. What was the body language of the others? 
5. When the other people were talking, what was running through his or her mind. If they can remember their own thoughts better than the signals being sent by the others, then this could be a sign of immaturity with the skill

Reflect on the responses to those questions and think about about their responses align to the stacking maturity scale for this skill.
