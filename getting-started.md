# Getting Started with the Tech Lead Coaching Network

This is a brief guide to describe what the Tech Lead Coaching Network is, who should and (shouldn't) join, and how to get started as a tech lead or a coach.

## This May Not Be For You.

Before reading further, ask yourself if you really want to get started with the **Tech Lead Coaching Network**. The Network is intended only for those who are *truly* interested in growing their technical leadership skills.

By contrast, if you’re considering joining the program only because your boss added it as a checklist on your annual review, then this program may not for you. Similarly, if you are currently struggling as tech lead, but you’re fundamentally only interested in doing the least possible to get by in your career, then this program is also not for you.

We say this because being in a leadership role -- truly stepping into it and seeking to make an impact on your life and others through your tech lead role -- takes a lot of commitment. 

## It May Be For You.

The Tech Lead Coaching Network, for both the tech leads receiving coaching and the tech leads doing the coaching, is a safe place to grow to be **the most impactful tech lead you can be**.

If you’re drawn to this program, then chances are you've got the right attitude to grow to become a strong leader, so working on it with our network of coaches may, possibly, be the best investment of time you can make. The Tech Lead Coaching Network may be exactly what you need.

## What is Tech Lead Coaching?

As just stated, a coaching relationship is really just an ongoing conersation in a safe space where tech leads and coaches talk through daily problems and frustrations to grow your impact as a tech lead over time.

It is **not**:
* a training program,
* a paid corporate offering, or
* tightly controlled by anyone.

It **is**:
* a free, community-based, and volunteer-driven organization;
* an opinionated (but not rigid), open source-based method focusing on key skills;
* flexible and structured around the needs and constraints of the tech lead and the coach;
* portable in that anyone can take the material and construct their own coaching network in house or in their own community; and
* built on the idea that coaches get as much out of the relationship as the tech leads.

## How to Get Started

It's easy! Sign up as a coach or a tech lead seeking coaching on our community webite: **[Tech Lead Coaching Networking](https://techleadcoaching.com)**

For now, until the network grows and we build a platform or application to match coaches and tech leads, the community's organizer, Michael Rice, is handling all the coordination and matching. If you want to reach him directly send an email to michael at techleadcoaching dot com.

## If You're Not Quite Ready To Get Started
