# Chapter Four: Tech Lead Coaching Logistics and Coaching Advice

In this chapter we're going to talk about the basic nuts and bolts of scheduling and structuring your sessions (especially the first seven sessions), communication tips, and some important advice about where to focus your coaching on.

## The Coaching Sessions

The coachings sessions, or conversations if you prefer, are scheduled times when you and your tech lead will talk. 

How you prefer to do it is completely up to you. If you happen to be physically nearby, it would be great if you can meet your tech lead for coffee, lunch, or whatever works for you. If you are not nearby, you may choose to have the conversation over the phone or over a video conference. Really the choice is up to you and your tech lead.

We provide some guidance in the next section on how to get started with a new coaching relationship.

But you can choose the structure of the conversation depending on works for both of you best. However, we do recommend that each conversation (with the exception of the first one, read below) touch on the following points:

1. Reaffirm the tech lead's goals for coaching - adjust if needed because the tech lead's goals will likely evolve, and we are not really focused on goals anyway - we are focused on the process of coaching and the tech lead's progress
2. Paraphrase the last call
3. Check in on the tech lead's current situation
4. Diving into one of the five Pareto skills from Chapter Three
5. Confirm schedule for the next call

Point number three is very simple but also very important. An easy way to open that conversation is to "How are you doing?" And then, using the listening skills we talked about in Chapter One, simply listening empathically and asking questions.

## The Seven Starter Sessions

We recommend the following structure for the first seven sessions. You are free to tailor the conversations based on what you are comfortable doing and saying, but we feel this should give both of you some confidence leaning on the structure of the conversation as you get started.

We offer tech leads the same guidance for the first seven conversations in the [Tech Lead's Guide](../tech-leads).

**Session One**: this should be a more in depth "get to know you" conversation than the **Introductory Call**. The call should have two halves to it:
* The first half of the conversation should be a bidirectional conversation about how you each got engaged with the Network, how you ended as a coach, and the tech lead's progression to the role. 
* The second half of the conversation should be an in depth conversation about what your tech's goals and challenges are.
At the end of this call, you should document what the goals are so that you can refer to them later. Keep these documents as safe and private as you would any human resources records.

**Sessions Two to Six**: the goal of these five sessions should be to get comfortable with the coaching relationship and to rely on the Tech Lead Coaching Network five skills as a framework to lean on as the two of you develop your relationship. The calls should roughly follow the following structure:
* start by reaffirming the tech lead's goals (3-5 minutes) and align on any adjustments
* ask the critical question: "how are you doing?" (5-15 minutes) and check in on the tech lead's goals set from the last call
* review the five Pareto skills and decide on which one to explore for this call, and then dive into it (~ 30 minutes)
* make a list of actions for your tech lead to work on until the next call (10-15 minutes)
* review whether structure of the call is working and what adjustments you each might want to make
* confirm schedule for the next call

**Session Seven**: this could be a short, relaxed check in call to confirm how the relationship is going and whether you and the tech lead want to continue. Future calls can continue the pattern set in sessions two to six, but by now you and your tech lead probably have something that's working for you that may differ from the structure proposed. If so, and it is working, then by all means continue. If not and you want to continue the relationship, this might be a good session to reset and review the structure to see how you might want to revise.

## How Often Should You Talk?

We recommend scheduling the first seven calls for a routine monthly cadence. 

Some coaching relationships may benefit from a much more rapid cadence, such as weely, and others may benefit from a rapid cadence in the benginning followed by much less frequent rate, such as quarterly.

Yet other relationships may call for only ad hoc, occaisional calls whenever a tech lead has problems or a coach wants to check in. 

Again, the choice is based on your bandwidth, the tech lead's bandwidth and needs, and how you negotiate those.

## How Long Should You Coach a Tech Lead For?

As long as you want! For some coaching relationships, you may not even make it through the Seven Starter Seessions. For others, you may go on for quite some time. The relationship is voluntary for both of you.

## Coach the Tech Lead, Not the Problem

When presented with someone's problem, most of us naturally and eagerly try to dive in and offer advice on how to solve it. This is especially true in software engineering and related fields because *most of us love solving problems*. This advice could be based on their own experience, their own ideas, what they saw work for someone else, almost anything.

The problem when you try to solve the problem, however, is that the conversation becomes centered on you.

In other words, the tech lead relates a problem to you. You take the problem in your head and start analyzing it and considering it based on your own experiences and knowledge. You start coming up with possible solutions. You get excited about the problem. And now you get excited to tell the tech lead you have come up with a wonderful solution. The tech lead, however, may or may not be excited about the solution and, if the conversation goes badly, you will be arguing about the merits of the solution.

If you notice what happened there, as soon as you understood the problem, your tech lead basically disappeared from the analysis. The tech lead may feel as if she or he has not been heard at all, which will unsatisfying for both of you.

So we **strongly** advise you to focus on coaching the tech lead, not the problem. 

This means that the tech lead needs to solve the problem, and you can simply ask them questions to see how they will solve it. Sometimes they may be stuck, but remember only they can get themselves unstuck and you can help them by asking them questions about what they have tried, why it what they tried did not work, what are some things they have not yet tried, and so. 

Keeping your mind from jumping in and "solutioning" is much easier said than done, of course. The easiest way to do it is to pay attention to your thoughts only to the extent that you monitor whether you are actually hearing the other person or whether you are analyzing their problem or situation for them. As soon as you have wandered off, come back the tech lead and use your wandering mind to ask a question to bring you back to what you missed the tech lead saying.

## Coaches' Support Network

On our roadmap is to develop an informal support network that we invite our coaches to join. Ask your community organizer about it.

## What To Do If Things Go Wrong

In the Tech Lead Coaching Network, we work with people. And people sometimes unpredictable and sometimes bad or inappropriate things. A tech lead might. Or you might.

We are a very new network, so for now we will handle everything ad hoc. If **any** concerns come up contact your community organizer right away.

As we grow, we will formalize some policies and processes to make sure this stays a safe place for everyone.

## What To Do When Things Go Right

Some experiences of coaching will be more rewarding than I can put into words. And besides, what you find exciting about it will be different from what I do.

But you fully engage in this, become skillful in your listening, I think you will find not only that you are looking forward to your next coaching conversation but that you will bring a higher and more impactful leadership to your own career, your family, and your community.

So when things go right, and they mostly will, my advice is simply to **enjoy the moment**. 

This is the most satisfying work I have found so far. I hope you enjoy it too.
