# Vision

The flipside of listening is, of course, speaking. And one of the most important things that leaders do is to frame his or her understanding of situations and articulating a vision about how the team should move forward. 

The term "vision" seems to evoke images of grand speeches like Martin Luther King Jr.'s *I Have a Dream* speech, but this skill at this level of leadership that most tech leads are in is actually fairly bland, mundane, and routine activity. Articulating a vision as a skill is simply demands that the tech lead knowing what outcome he or she wants in a given situation, how effectively the tech lead can express that desire (ideally in a compelling way), and whether he or she is telling the team and how frequently.

#### The Vision Maturity Stacking Scale

Like listening, the maturity scale for the vision skill is a stacking one: each skill builds on the next.

At the **beginner** level, tech leads will either express no particular vision about any given situation or will articulate an uncompelling or unclear vision. If they do have a vision they may either not communicate it to the team or do so with considerable anxiety. This is an interesting area of leadership development because new tech leads may stifle their own inner voices about what they want because they are interrupted by whatever else is going on. But knowing what you want is a critical thing to be clear about as a leader so help them think it through.

At the **intermediate** level, the tech lead now has increased capabilities to articulate a vision that is not only clear and cogent but also has some compelling aspects to it. At this level, however, the tech lead may still be not communicating the vision frequently to his or her team or at all. Often, tech leads at this level underestimate how frequently their team needs to be reminded of the vision let alone taking the time to tell each team member how he or she fits into the vision.

At the **advanced** level, the tech lead is able to articulate clear, compelling visions and frequently invokes the vision in challenging and routine situations. Moreover, the tech lead is able to adapt the vision's message to different constituencies (including management) as well as taking the time to individually explain to team members how their work fits into the vision -- no matter how grand or small that vision is.

#### How to Explore the Vision Skill in Your Coaching

This is a surprisingly hard skill, even for highly experienced leaders, but it is a relatively easy one to probe your tech lead on. When they describe a situation, ask them what their vision was. 
1. Assess whether you think the vision is clear or compelling
2. Ask them whether they told the team
3. Whether the team is clear on the vision and how they know (or don't)
4. Ask them how often they repeat the vision (and challenge for specific situations)
5. Then ask them what other moments they might have missed to articulate the vision

Since this skill is a fairly black and white activity they will do or not do, be careful not to put them on the defensive through your questioning. It may be helpful to start a conversation about this skill by referring them to the materials in their [Tech Lead's Guide](../tech-leads) so they understand the line of questioning without being too defensive.
