# What Coaching is NOT

One major source of anxiety about coaching for new tech lead coaches is that they have assumptions about who coaches are and what coaches do. These assumptions come from popular images of coaches, which you will learn are actually inconsistent with the approch we take at the Tech Lead Coaching Network. 

For example, when you think of a coach, your first thought might be sports. You may imagine a coach screaming at players from the sidelines, directing them what to do, berating them for failures. I tend to imagine Bill Bellichik, the six time Super Bowl winning New England Patriots coach, scowling at his players no matter whether the team is winning or losing. 

Or maybe you might imagine a coach in a gym or training program. You might imagine that coach watching an athlete and providing some kind of hidden insight or advice to correct the athelete's performance. 

If you are aware of executive or life coaching programs, you may even think of coaching as some kind activity that either for elite, high level executives or as some kind of "new agey" way of getting an alternative form of therapy.

Coaching is many things and, in those contexts, is maybe all of those those things. In the context of our Network of tech leads, however, **coaching is none of those things**.
