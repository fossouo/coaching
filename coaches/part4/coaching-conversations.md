# The Coaching Sessions

The coachings sessions, or conversations if you prefer, are scheduled times when you and your tech lead will talk. 

How you prefer to do it is completely up to you. If you happen to be physically nearby, it would be great if you can meet your tech lead for coffee, lunch, or whatever works for you. If you are not nearby, you may choose to have the conversation over the phone or over a video conference. Really the choice is up to you and your tech lead.

We provide some guidance in the next section on how to get started with a new coaching relationship.

But you can choose the structure of the conversation depending on works for both of you best. However, we do recommend that each conversation (with the exception of the first one, read below) touch on the following points:

1. Reaffirm the tech lead's goals for coaching - adjust if needed because the tech lead's goals will likely evolve, and we are not really focused on goals anyway - we are focused on the process of coaching and the tech lead's progress
2. Paraphrase the last call
3. Check in on the tech lead's current situation
4. Diving into one of the five Pareto skills from Chapter Three
5. Confirm schedule for the next call

Point number three is very simple but also very important. An easy way to open that conversation is to "How are you doing?" And then, using the listening skills we talked about in Chapter One, simply listening empathically and asking questions.
