# Chapter Two: Tech Lead Pareto Skills

## Introduction

Day to day, as a tech lead, you will find yourself doing many things and going through many, rapid context switches. 

You might start your day early in the morning trying to troubleshoot a production bug and having to pull together other engineers to help resolve it on short notice (early in the morning). Other days may involve impromptu meetings with senior company leaders where you need to be able to confidently describe the progress of the a feature your team is building. On yet other days you may be simply doing deep technical work writing code and helping to manage code releases. 

On some days you could be doing all three in one day!

The specific tasks you do as a tech lead will vary a great deal from one organization or enterprise to another. In fact, sometimes the tech lead role varies a lot even with the same company or even from project to project. Sometimes tech leads act a lot like scrumasters or project managers. In others, they may act a like managers and even have some people management responsilities. And in yet others, the role might require the tech lead to simply write a lot of core code for a project and then mentor others on how to do something similar. 

Each of these different moments or expectations for the tech lead role are going to draw on different skills you have or that you need to develop. In some cases, the emphasis will be on technical skills. Sometimes it's more about coordination. 

## Tech Versus Lead Skills

The tech lead role has two words in it: tech and lead. It is convenient that both words have the same number of words, so the concepts are balanced in characters, even if the actual weighting of tech skills and lead skills will shift considerably from day to day in practice. 

So before we get started, we should make clear that tech leads will need to stay current with their technical skillset and continue to invest in that core skillset. Staying current not only keeps you grounded in your technical field but also keeps you engaged in the engineering team through the day to day technical work and the many small choices that need to be made as your team does its work.

As you grow in your technical leadership, the emphasis of your learning may evolve from a deep investment on, say, a specific technical aspect of React Router (to pick just one random example) to a broader fluency in software engineering practices (or whatever specific technical field you're in), such as more sophisticated source control methods, continuous integration techniques, software craftsmanship generally, design patterns and antipatterns, and more. 

But this guide will not say much more about technology since only you know about your technical field and we could not possibly cover them all here. Besides, you can likely find plenty of guidance on what you need to know somewhere else.

You got to this point in your career likely because you have strong tech skills or at least strong enough that you can contribute at a high level in your enterprise as an individual contributor. What we are going to focus on in this guide, in your coaching relationship, and the Network overall, are the so-called soft skills of technical leadership, which are actually quite hard skills to develop.

## The Touchstone Skill of a Tech Lead: Effectively Navigating Hard Conversations

Before we get into what what we call the five, core Pareto skills, let us explore a key aspect of your work as a tech lead that few are honest enough to discuss publicly.

If you recall from the list of things that tech leads may be called to do in [Chapter One](./intro), most of them, to be effective, require you to speak up in certain moments and, possibly, **say things that others may not agree with**. For many, *anxieties about this reality undermine their impact*. 

For example, in some cases you need to be the final decision maker for key architectural design choices, and the team may or may not agree with the trade offs you make. You may need to tell a product manager that a feature cannot be built the way he or she wants. You may need to team members to do something different than they want to do or even tell them that what they did was wrong and correct it.  

If you have spent most of your career thus far as an individual contributor, these could be quite uncomfortable conversations to have. They are hard for everyone in any context, but they can be particularly hard as a tech lead where you likely do not have much experience nor authority in these situations.

There could be many reasons why that you should explore with your coach, but it doesn't really matter what they are. You can get good at having these difficult conversations, and the Pareto skills below will help. 

You'll know you're getting good as a tech lead when you are able to both navigate technical issues and decisions, and, most importantly, engage in these conversations confidently, effectively, and in a sustainable way. 

The skills and capabilities proposed below should help.

## The Five Pareto Skills

If you have not heard of the Pareto principle before, Vilfredo Pareto was a ninteenth century Italian economist who noticed that twenty percent of Italians owned eighty percent of the land. The Pareto principle was popularized as the 80/20 rule because it seems to hold in so many circumstances, such as the economics, sports, safety, crime, gambling, health care, and even software bug reports, according to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle). As you will see, we believe the Pareto principle holds for your tech leadership as well.

We believe the following five skills, if you work through them and grow in maturity within each of them, will make you an impactful tech lead and make it easier for you to navigate those hard conversations we just talked about. These won't be all the skills you need all of the time, but these five will take you about 80% of the way down the road to being a great tech lead.

We ask our coaches to focus on:
1. your ability to **listen** effectively to your team, your organizational network, and your management,
2. the way that you **take initiative** to take action at work (in whatever context you are in),
3. how well and how often you **articulate a vision** for a given moment or given project,
4. how you approach and execute the **tracking and adjusting** aspects of the tech lead role, and 
5. your own **growth mindset** as it pertains to yourself, your team, and your team's growth.

### Listening

Being a great tech lead starts with great listening skills. 

Communication is said to be the hallmark of leadership. Communication has, of course, many aspects to it, including speaking and listening. But listening is the most important because, through listening, you get the raw data you need to take the right and most impactful actions. Listening is the foundation of your tech leadership.

You are not, however, simply a good listener or a bad listener--despite what your significant other says. It is more correct to say that you are either more or less skillful at it. Moreover, your skill probably varies a bit with the context. So you can think of your skill level on a continuum within a context, where each level builds on the next. 

At the **beginner** level, tech leads tend to focus principally on the content of whatever message is sent to them. It could be the facts, the factual assertions, the information coming from the sender. In our technical field, this content is obviously critically important to receive. 

Unfortunately, some tech leads fail to listen effectively even on this level, and there could be many reasons for it, which are probably best left to you and your coach.

At the **intermediate** level, tech leads build on their content focus and begin to synthesize it with the context and the body language of the senders. This is a improvement in skill because, even in a highly technical field like ours where content seems to be king, there is almost always more to the message than the content. So being able to read the non-verbal signals correctly within the context is the mark of someone who is making signficant growth in their ability to listen. 

Even at this level, however, your ability to fully hear the full message can impeded by your own needs, whether it is pressure from the project, your own insecurities, or your feelings about the sender can either block some aspects of the message or filter other aspects of the message. Thus, **advanced** listeners are able to put their own needs aside and absorb the full messsage empathically. 

This is a very hard level almost for everyone to attain and sustain consistently so relax and work with your coach on it.

### Taking Initiative

Taking initiative is normally thought of as a skill that managers emphasize for senior individual contributors. It can be a very impactful skill to bring to your early leadership roles, however, because it is the skill and drive you need to step into as many of the right leadership moments as you can.

When applied to your tech lead role, taking initiative as a skill is focused on how often and effectively you seize moments to either (1) step into opportunities to lead come up or (2) put your team "on the hook" for something and being accountable to follow through on the result. Both of these are practical, day to day examples of **leadership moments** that we want you to embrace. But if you are very new to the tech lead role, these leadership moments might seem a bit abstract, so explore them with your coach.

The way we evaluate this capability is more like a sliding scale than the stacking skillset of listening. At the left edge of the scale, a **beginner** level generally means that, as a tech lead, you are reluctant to step into those leadership moments. There could be any number of valid reasons why a tech lead is reluctant to step into these leadership moments, from a basic lack of skill to a more fundamental fear of failure, and your coach may want to explore them. 

An **intermediate** level of maturity with this skill is exactly the reverse of the beginner level. At this level, you may find yourself jumping into many leadership moments and volunteering your team to take initiative with ease. This is a big step up in maturity and is an easy path to promotion because you are likely making yourself visible as an emerging, high energy leader at your organization. 

However, there is, of course, a downside risk at this level. If you overweight on leadership moments or put your team on too many hooks, you could be stretching yourself and your team too thin and your outcomes may be uneven due, at least in part, to challenge of focusing your team on too many things at one. 

The **advanced** level, then, is the middle way between committing your team to taking on too much initiative and taking on too little. But the middle path is not about simply scaling back. It is about having the maturity and understanding of both you and your team's capabilities and matching them up to only (but as many as possible) opportunities to have the most impact.

### Articulating a Vision

Speaking and articulating your point of view is the other key communication skill that we described in the first Pareto skill. But here, we focus primarily on how well you are synthesizing your understanding of the situation and then articulating a vision for how to proceed. You may create the vision on your own or you may cause it to emerge from your conversations with the team.

The word "vision" may evoke almost impossibly aspirational images in your mind of visionary leaders like John F. Kennedy, Jr., and his vision that America would be the first country to walk on the moon. What we are talking about it far more mundane, but still critically important.

At your leadership level, your vision for a project, feature, or whatever may feel so modest or obvious that it may hardly feel like a "vision" at all. It may simply seem like an intuitive sense of what needs to happen in a given moment. But it takes vision nonetheless, and you should focus on it as a skill. You would be suprised how many tech leads overlook or fail in this step.

For example, you may be in the middle of a database upgrade requiring some code changes and a new release. That may feel like "just work," but perhaps you have a vision for how it will go well: you need to make the cutover with little downtime and, ideally, zero data loss or outages for users. 

How clearly are you stating that this is what you want to happen? How often? This is what we are talking about in this section on "vision." Defining and articulating a vision is practical and attainable, even for the newest tech leads.

At the **beginner** level you may struggle to be able to clearly articulate what you want the team to do. At this level, you may know what needs to be done, you believe your team knows what needs to be done, and, most importantly, you believe that everyone should "just know." Most of the tech leads I have worked with spend most of their time at this level so don't sweat it if this is where you are. 

You can grow to the **intermediate** level where, even if you think it is obvious to you, you are now able to clearly tell the team where you think the team should go and, at this more advanced level, at least sometimes, *why it matters*. The vision you express to the team is attainable and clear (like getting through the database upgrade described above) and it is messaged in a way that the team believes they can execute on it (even if they need to stretch a bit).

The **advanced** level of vision setting is a powerful one, even with fairly mundane initiatives. This is where you are able to articulate not only a clear vision but a compelling one (e.g., the what, the how, and, most importantly, the *why*). This is highly impactful because those difficult conversations we talked about generally melt away and both you and the team feel like you are at least all pointed in the right direction. 

### Tracking and Adjusting

One of the most routine tasks you probably do each day as a tech lead is to keep track of what the team is doing and/or make adjustments to their work. Like setting visions for small technical tasks, you may barely be aware of the importance of the tracking and adjusting work you are doing day in and day out.

At the **beginner** level we tell our coaches to pay particular attention to the extent to which you rely on technology, such as Github pull requests, Trello cards, Slack, and etc. to keep track of your team. 

This may seem like an odd area to have our coaches dive into because it seems arbitrary and, besides, those tools give feel effecient, especially with remote teams. And for day to day communication, the tools may be completely fine. The risk we want our coaches to focus on is whether you are using the tools as a crutch to avoid difficult or challenging face to face conversations. 

As a tech lead, you simply have to track and adjust *somehow*, and if you are relying heavily on technology to do it, doing so could be a telling signal of your maturity in this skill.

At the **intermediate** level you may be much more willing to engage in face to face conversations fairly often, but you may be reluctant to engage in some of those difficult conversations where you need to make changes in what an engineer is doing out of fear that the conversation could get confrontational. 

This level is a step up from the beginner level, however, so if you are making progress. At least you're probably flirting with those conversations.

At the **advanced** level you are able to engage one on one with your team on difficult issues and able to do it in such a way that each team member feels valued and buys into the adjustment you are making. 

Wherever you feel you are with this capability, relax a little and believe me when I say this is not an easy level to consistently perform at a high level, so don't worry if you struggle with it. We all do--even those most experienced leaders. You may find it easy with some relationships, and more difficult with others. Thus, this is an important area to explore with your coach. 

### Your Growth Mindset

Your growth mindset capability is really just the mindset that you bring to the job every day. A strong capability in growth mindset means that you believe, correctly, that all people have the ability to grow in *every area* of their lives, including you. 

We emphasize it in the five Pareto capabilities because if you are positively biased on this, it gives you a high angle of trajectory to growing not only your own skills but your team's as well. Conversely, a negative bias on this will change the shape and trajectory of your growth as a tech lead. 

Perhaps interestingly, We ask our coaches **not** to try to do anything to change this, since they are not therapists and, since your mindset was largely formed in the past, this is not a place your coaching conversations should be focused on.

However, we do want them to problem and challenge your thinking on this point where appropriate because if you believe, as we believe you *should*, that you, your team, your management, your company, even your family members are not static in their capabilities. 

We strongly value and believe that *everyone* has the ability to grow and contribute at higher levels in all aspects of their lives. 

One practical way of exploring this capability is to discuss your orientation towards goals or process as a tech lead.

We tell our coaches that, as a tech lead, you are at the **beginner** level if you focus primarily on goals. The goals could come from your management or they could be goals you have articulated for yourself or your team. Goals are a good thing. They help to make things happen, so be relaxed that this is an impactful level.

The higher level, the **intermediate** level takes your impact to another level, however. By focusing on goals, you run the risk of putting the goal ahead of the needs of the individuals on the team and their capabilities to contribute to future goals. By shifting your focus to the process you and and your team follow to consistently reach goals, you will start operating at a much higher level. Your coach will be asking questions about this.

Once you reach the **advanced** level of this capability, it may be time for you to start considering being a coach in the Tech Lead Coaching Network yourself because at this level you are not only focusing on the process but you are likely building leaders within your own team.
