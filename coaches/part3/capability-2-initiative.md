# Taking Initiative/Ownership

Taking initiative sounds like a checkbox on an annual performance report, but it is truly an impact skill for the tech lead to develop. Leaders, once they have understanding from listening above, have impact by the choices and actions they take. Taking initiative is usually thought of as a skill we ask senior software engineers to focus on, but it remains a key skill to work on as a tech lead moves into the role. The initiative for a lead is more about put his or her team out there and being accountable for reaching for a result..

In some of our other material, podcasts, and the [Tech Lead Guide](../tech-leads), we encourage tech leads to spot and step into leadership moments. A simple way to assess whether your tech lead is doing this is by exploring how often and what kinds of initiative he or she is taking in certain moments.

In scaling approach for this skill, the first two maturities are the full scale: from doing nothing to doing too much. The third is the "middle way" of choosing only to take initiative on the kinds of activities where the tech lead knows he or she can have an impact.

#### The Sliding Maturity Scale of Initiative Taking

At the **beginner** level, tech leads may take very little initiative and, possibly when they do, they express considerable anxiety or reservations about the actions they are taking. Part of this conservative approach to initiative could be rooted in the tech lead's inexperience with the role and/or fear of failing when they take action. At this level as the coach, you can ask questions to strengthen the tech lead's confidence that the actions they take are good.

At the **intermediate** level, the tech lead is liberally taking initiative and stepping into many leadership moments. This can be very impactful in that the tech lead is probably very visible within his or her organization and may be known by a level of high energy or commitment, as evidenced by the sheer amount of "diving in" that the tech lead is doing. A lack of delegation is often the hallmark of this level as well.

At the **advanced** level, the tech lead begins to realize that stepping into too many moments or taking too much initiative can be exhausting at best and career damaging at worst if the tech lead is spread so thin that he or she gets some bad results as of a lack of focus. So at this advanced level, the tech lead has the maturity to pick and choose as many opportunities as possible so long as they are able to follow through and have an impact with their team. This level may also be marked by increasing fluency with delegation.

#### How to Explore Initiative Taking in Your Coaching

Taking initiative is a simple skill to understand but it can often be a loaded term, so a way to conceptualize the skill while you are in the middle of the conversation is to imagine someone being completely passive or doing nothing at all in the situation being described.

1. When the tech lead is describing a challenging situation that seems to be happening around or to him or her, ask what he or she is doing to take action in the moment
2. If the team lead seems to be expressing a desire for something to be different or for some kind of outcome to happen, ask what actions he or she taking to bring into reality
