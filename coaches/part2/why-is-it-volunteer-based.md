# Why is it Volunteer-based?

One question that comes up is why the Tech Lead Coaching Network is volunteer-based. After all, this kind of coaching takes time and is valuable for the tech leads receiving coaching.

There are a few reasons. First, most of our coaches are fairly new to the coaching process, so it does not seem realistic at this point to ask tech leads to pay money. Second, the amount of money you might receive for coaching is pretty low compared to the non-monetary benefits you will receive as a coach, including substantial growth in your own leadership, which should lead to more money for you in your career.

Finally, as a coach, if you truly love doing it and want to take on paying clients, you are absolutely free to do that. You can even use our training and support network to jumpstart your career. You will just need to find your own clients. As a volunteer organization, we will not match you up with paying clients through the Tech Lead Coaching Network.
