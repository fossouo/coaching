# The Tech Lead's Invididual Growth Mindset

This is not so much of a skill as a capability or a mindset that the tech lead has. It has a tinge of a new age feel to it, but it is actually very practical and critically important to the tech lead's maturity growth in the four skills. It has to do with the mindset that the tech lead brings to work with him or her every day and to what extent he or she is able to see their own leadership grow. 

We add it the Pareto capabilities because (1) it helps you and the tech lead understand how their growth will be shaped in the role and (2) it is the foundation for higher levels of impact in their leadership.

#### The Indidivual Growth Mindset Sliding Scale

This scale is more like a sliding one in that the tech lead may land on any given position depending on the context.

At the **beginner** level, the tech lead is motivated almost entirely on hitting goals, whether those goals were given to the team by management or the tech lead articulated those goals to the team through vision setting. This is the position most of us are in almost all the time, so there is nothing wrong with this level. And besides, hitting goals is a very impactful way to get a lot done! There are some downsides to this level, however, in that the goal focus can, sometimes, impede the tech lead's ability to build a team, and so the goal achievement may be uneven.

At the **intermediate** level, the tech lead's motivation changes and rather than placing a goal driven approach at the pinnacle of his or her leadership, the tech lead begins to focus on the process for hitting goals. The process could be the individual's process for approaching the team, or the process for the team itself. Agile methods tend to put the focus on this level, so you may have to probe a little further to see if the tech lead is treating a retro a yet another goal to check off or a true moment to inspect and adapt.

At the **advanced** level, the the tech lead is committed to not only his or her own growth but in growing leadership on the team itself. At this point, you may want to encourage the tech lead to step up and start coaching through the Tech Lead Coaching Network.


#### How to Explore the Tracking and Adjusting Skill in Your Coaching

I heard an analogy recently that may be helpful for you while you are having a conversation. Imagine a farm whether there are only two types of animals: cows and horses. The cows are pretty slow moving and seem perfectly content standing around chewing their cud. By contrast, the horses want to run, play, fight, and generally explore. The tech lead's growth mindset could be considered similar. Do you feel they are striving to grow or do they just want to check the box to say they hit the goal or didn't.

This is one area where you may not be able to do much as a coach -- remember you are not a therapist and your objective is not to probe the future or the past. People's mindsets take a lifetime to create and take time to change -- and can only be changed if they want. And do not judge the tech lead if they are relatively immature on this scale. We all have our valid reasons for the way we see life.

Thus you may not be able to truly coach them to a different level; however, if you hear immature (cow-like) responses of comments that frustrate you, there are many positive questions you can ask to encourage them to see their growth capability as more dynamic. Understanding this scale will help you understand the progress in the other areas and how to tailor your approach.
