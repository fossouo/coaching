# Summary of the Core Skills and Capabilities
The following table, still in progress, defines the core skills that we feel, if focused on, contribute strongly to an individual tech lead's impactfulness in the role. It may be helpful to print this off or keep it handy during your conversations.

You will notice that within each skill, we offer a maturity scale with some behaviors that may be markers of the tech lead's skill progression.

| Skill |  Beginners | Intermediate | Advanced |
|-------|--------------------|--------------|----------|
| Listening | Focuses on content | Synthesizes context + body language | Empathic understanding
| Taking Initiative | Occaisional w/ anxiety | Confident but too frequent | Restrained, focused, impactful |
| Vision | Unclear or uncompelling vision | Clarity w/o consistent messaging | Compelling, frequent communication |
| Tracking and Adjusting | Relies excessively on technology | Face to face; slow to adjust | Fluidly adjusts and anticipates |
| Individual Growth Mindset | Goal driven | Process driven | Grows team's capabilities |

In the sections that follow, we give you tools to help develop these skills in your tech leads. First, we explore the dimensions of the skill - what it is and what is not. Then we describe the maturity scale for each skill. In some cases the skills build on each other. In others, the skill is more like a sliding scale. Finally, we give you some conversational guidance on how to explore the tech lead's capabilities and maturity with each skill.
