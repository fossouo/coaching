# How We Assign Tech Leads

The next big question that gets asked is how you get tech leads to coach. 

One way we could have structured the Network is to make it a place where tech leads and coaches could self organize and find each other through the web platform. If we grow substantially, that may be one way we consider going.

For now, tech leads will be assigned to you by a community organizer.

When tech leads apply for coaching, we go through a similar intake process as the one you will go through. The organizer will scan the bench of coaches (where you will start) and try to play matchmaker between you and the tech lead.

The first step is that the organizer will share your **Coach Profile** with the candidate tech lead to make sure they are comfortable to proceed. And, likewise, if the tech lead is comfortable proceeding, the organizer will share the tech lead's profile with you to confirm that you are comfortable.

From there, the organizer will schedule a session with you, the tech lead, and the organizer to make the introduction (more about this later).
