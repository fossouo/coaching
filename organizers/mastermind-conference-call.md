# Weekly Mastermind/Conference Call

Recommended for network organizers who want to share information about the their network and, possibly, draw in new tech leads and coaches.

## Timing and Cadence

Ideally the calls should take less than 45 minutes and should be scheduled at a time when most members can join (e.g., right before the work day, at lunch, or right after the normal close of business). The calls can be as frequent or infrequent as makes sense for your community, but should probably be held at least once a quarter for a small or new network.

## Agenda

**Vision statement** Always start by clearly reminding participants of the network's vision. Assume there will be new members on the call so try to keep it as fresh and compelling as possible :-)

**New Members** *Optional* Start by reading out new members and warmly welcoming them, if the members are willing.

**Network Updates** Read out other updates or organizational points of interest to the community.

**Roundtable Topic** Either the organizer or a member selected from a prior call will lead by raising and exploring a topic related to tech leadership. The topic could be based on a real life situation, a topic of interest in the in industry, or a case study from the tech lead workshops project.

**Discussion** The members will then be invited to partipate in the discussion. If there are many participants on the call, the organizer or moderator should probably control who speaks through a tool like Zoom or WebEx to control noise. The organizer should close the discussion with a summary of some of the important points raised.

**Next Topic Selection** The organizer should then invite members to select a new topic of discussion or at least agree on a mechanism to do so (e.g., via email, Slack, or some other process)

**Announce Next Call** The organizer should announce the time and date of the next call and warmly invite the members to join the next call.

Good luck organizer! We <3 you. Let us know if you need help.
