# Summary
In summary, I hope that seeing the coaching process as simply one in which you listen empathically and probe through questions takes some of the anxiety away from you. 

And I hope seeing your role as a coach primarily one who supports the tech lead who will solve his or her own problems (not as the problem solver yourself), also makes you feel confident you can do this. 

Because you can.
