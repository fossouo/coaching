# Other Tips

## Coaches' Support Network

On our roadmap is to develop an informal support network that we invite our coaches to join. Ask your community organizer about it.

## What To Do If Things Go Wrong

In the Tech Lead Coaching Network, we work with people. And people sometimes unpredictable and sometimes bad or inappropriate things. A tech lead might. Or you might.

We are a very new network, so for now we will handle everything ad hoc. If **any** concerns come up contact your community organizer right away.

As we grow, we will formalize some policies and processes to make sure this stays a safe place for everyone.

## What To Do When Things Go Right

Some experiences of coaching will be more rewarding than I can put into words. And besides, what you find exciting about it will be different from what I do.

But you fully engage in this, become skillful in your listening, I think you will find not only that you are looking forward to your next coaching conversation but that you will bring a higher and more impactful leadership to your own career, your family, and your community.

So when things go right, and they mostly will, my advice is simply to **enjoy the moment**. 

This is the most satisfying work I have found so far. I hope you enjoy it too.
