# Skill 1/2 - Listening and Coaching Conversation

When you are coaching the tech lead, the most important thing to bring is your empathic listening techniques. 

Most of us are unskillful at this at first, but it is easy to explain. By *empathic*, we mean that you simply need to put your own needs aside for a while. 

**Coaching conversations** are one hundred percent about the tech lead you are coaching. You may feel urges to direct them, offer advice, and solve problems while you are listening to them, but these tendencies take you away from focusing on the tech lead.

In fact, those kinds of thoughts are unhelpful because they shift the focus to you as a coach, your experiences, and your own desires to jump in and help, but the coaching conversation isn't about you; it's about your tech lead.

Empathic techniques demand that you focus on what the tech lead is saying, watch the nonverbal cues, be supportive, keep your own judgments out of your head (again, doing so shifts the focus to you) and ask yourself how this tech lead is going to solve his or her problems or overcome a challenge. What capability does this tech lead need to unlock to solve a particular problem?

It's almost like a meditation. When you feel you mind wandering to a solution while the tech lead is talking, bring it gently back to what's being said -- not the inner dialog in you own head.

Doing these things essentially gives your tech lead the sensation of being actually heard and being able to air some thoughts and, the wonderful part about this, is that **the tech lead will likely solve their own problems in ways you couldn't**. 

Your tech lead's solution may not be the solution you would try, but remember, your tech lead is the one who has to live this and they are the ones with the context -- not you.

You may not be the strongest empathic listener right now. It's not a skill many of us learned, especially in technical fields. 

But I want you to see coaching through the Tech Lead Coaching Network as a unique opportunity to develop this skill. After all, it is a powerful skill that is useful in many contexts -- both professional and personal.
