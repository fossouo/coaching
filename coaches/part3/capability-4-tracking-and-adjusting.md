# Tracking and Adjusting

A core, day to day activity for most tech leads is to track the team's activity and to make many small alignment adjustments to inviduals' work and/or reporting adjustments in either technology, schedules, or other technical issues to the next level of management or other consitutencies. 

It is *such* a routine activity for most tech leads that they may not even have a conscious awareness that they are doing it or whether they are effective in this skill.

#### The Tracking and Adjusting Stacking Maturity Scale

Growing in this skill is also a stacking set of skills.

At the **beginner** level, tech leads who lack maturity in this skill may rely excessively on technology. For example, the tech lead may rely heavily on comments to Github pull requests, comments on Trello cards, communicating via Slack, or agile tracking tools. It is possible that they truly believe the technology is an efficient form of communication. But at this level, they lack an understanding that to be effective, they have to engage in fairly inefficient face to face communications at times. The technology may be appropriate for the team, but the test is whether it the tech lead can switch to face to face meetings when needed.

At the **intermediate** level, tech leads exhibit more confidence in engaging in full bandwidth, live conversations more frequently. But they are slow to make adjustments during thos conversations. For example, the tech lead may believe that he or she needs an engineer to do something differently, but is reluctant to make that adjustment during that conversation because he or she fears a difficult conversation. Instead, the tech lead may return to his or her computer and ask for the change via Slack or email, or may not make the change at all.

At the **advanced** level, the tech lead is able to confidently "walk the halls" and engage in on the spot, live alignment adjustments that, even if they are somewhat confrontational, result in a stronger team. Moreover, when this skill is combined with maturity in the vision and listening skill, the tech lead is able to fluidly anticipate changes that need to happen before the moments become confrontational.

#### How to Explore the Tracking and Adjusting Skill in Your Coaching

Engaging your tech lead on this skill is typically a fairly easy conversation. 
1. Ask them to describe the day to day work and how they keep track of stuff
2. Probe for an understanding the extent of their reliance on technology and the reasons behind its us
3. Explore moments where they feel the method may fail them or be ineffective
4. Explore moments where they have to make corrections or adjustments in the work that their team is doing
5. How do they do it and how confident do they feel making those adjustments
