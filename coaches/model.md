# The Tech Lead Coaching Model

TODO: convert the coaching model into markdown, the core skills, and how to support your tech lead to the next level

## Summary of the Core Skills and Behaviors
The following table, still in progress, defines the core skills that we feel, if focused on, contribute strongly to an individual tech lead's impactfulness in the role.

*It is by no means an exhaustive set of the skills or capabilities needed*; instead, it focuses on a small set of actionable skills and demonstrated maturity that will help a tech lead grow.

Additionally, the table summarizes some of the behaviors that the coach may detect to assess an individual and for the pair to make an agreement to work on together from beginner through advanced. More detail about the skills and behaviors will follow.

| Skill |  Beginners | Intermediate | Advanced |
|-------|--------------------|--------------|----------|
| Listening | Focuses on content | Synthesizes context + body language | Empathic understanding
| Taking Initiative | Occaisional w/ anxiety | Confident but too frequent | Restrained, focused, impactful |
| Vision | Unclear or uncompelling vision | Clarity w/o consistent messaging | Compelling, frequent communication |
| Tracking and Adjusting | Relies excessively on technology | Face to face; slow to adjust | Fluidly adjusts and anticipates |
| Individual Growth Mindset | Goal driven | Process driven | Grows team's capabilities |
