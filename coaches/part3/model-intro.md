# The Tech Lead Coaching Model

In addition to the getting started guidance we offer in Chapter Two and the mechanics and logistics of the coaching conversations that we will explore in Chapter Four, the following section provides some specific, practical guidance for coaches to focus conversations on. 

The focus is on the tech lead's maturity in five key skills.

While the conversations can go in any direction you want, we feel that using listening and questioning methods with your tech lead to focus on these five skills will grow their leadership cabilities in their tech lead careers so they have a bigger impact.

We call them "Pareto skills" based on the famous Pareto principle. New for some of you and review for others, Vilfredo Pareto was an Italian economist who noticed that twenty percent of Italians owned eighty percent of the land in Italy. The Pareto principle was later popularized as the 80/20 rule because it seems to describe so many circumstances, such as the economics, sports, safety, crime, gambling, health care, and even software bug reports, according to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle).
