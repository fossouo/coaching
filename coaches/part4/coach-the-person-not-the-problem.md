# Coach the Tech Lead, Not the Problem

When presented with someone's problem, most of us naturally and eagerly try to dive in and offer advice on how to solve it. This is especially true in software engineering and related fields because *most of us love solving problems*. This advice could be based on their own experience, their own ideas, what they saw work for someone else, almost anything.

The problem when you try to solve the problem, however, is that the conversation becomes centered on you.

In other words, the tech lead relates a problem to you. You take the problem in your head and start analyzing it and considering it based on your own experiences and knowledge. You start coming up with possible solutions. You get excited about the problem. And now you get excited to tell the tech lead you have come up with a wonderful solution. The tech lead, however, may or may not be excited about the solution and, if the conversation goes badly, you will be arguing about the merits of the solution.

If you notice what happened there, as soon as you understood the problem, your tech lead basically disappeared from the analysis. The tech lead may feel as if she or he has not been heard at all, which will unsatisfying for both of you.

So we **strongly** advise you to focus on coaching the tech lead, not the problem. 

This means that the tech lead needs to solve the problem, and you can simply ask them questions to see how they will solve it. Sometimes they may be stuck, but remember only they can get themselves unstuck and you can help them by asking them questions about what they have tried, why it what they tried did not work, what are some things they have not yet tried, and so. 

Keeping your mind from jumping in and "solutioning" is much easier said than done, of course. The easiest way to do it is to pay attention to your thoughts only to the extent that you monitor whether you are actually hearing the other person or whether you are analyzing their problem or situation for them. As soon as you have wandered off, come back the tech lead and use your wandering mind to ask a question to bring you back to what you missed the tech lead saying.
