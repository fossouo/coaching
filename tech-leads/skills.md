# Chapter Two: Tech Lead Pareto Skills

[From the overview: Chapter Two goes beyond the description of the day to day tasks described Chapter One to explore the soft skills that are required for most tech leads to be successful. It then zooms in on the five skills that we advise coaches to focus on during coaching sessions. We call then the Pareto skills because we feel those five skills, when developed to maturity, can have the biggest shift on the tech lead's ability to impact their enterprises or organizations.]

## Introduction

Day to day, tech leads will find themselves doing many things and going through many, rapid context switches. They might start their day early in the morning trying to troubleshoot a production bug and having to pull together other engineers to help resolve it on short notice. Other days may involve impromptu meetings with more senior leaders of the company where they need to be able to confidently describe the progress of the a feature their team is building. On other days they may be simply doing deep technical work writing code and helping to manage code releases. On some days they could be doing all three in one day!

The specific tasks will vary a great deal from one organization or enterprise to another. Sometimes the tech lead role varies a lot even with the same company or even from project to project. Sometimes tech leads act a lot like scrumasters or project managers. In others, they may act a like managers and even have some people management responsilities. And in yet others, the role might require the tech lead to write a lot of core code for a project. 

Each of these different moments or expectations for the tech lead role are going to draw on different skills. In some cases, the emphasis will be on technical skills. Indeed, the tech lead role obviously has a huge technical component to it. 

## Tech Versus Lead Skills

The tech lead role has two words in it: tech and lead. It is convenient that both words have the same number of characters the concepts are perfectly balanced, even if the actual weighting of tech skills and lead skills will shift a lot from day to day in practice. 

So before we get started, we should make clear that tech leads will need to stay current with their technical skillset and continue to invest in that skillset. If you cannot stay current, then you will have a hard time leading your engineering team through the day to day technical work and the millions of small choices that need to be made as your team does its work.

As you grow in technical leadership, the emphasis of your learning may change a little from a deep investment on, say, a specific technical aspect of React Router (to pick just one random example) to a broader fluency in software engineering practices (or whatever technical field you're in), such as strong source control methods, continuous integration techniques, software craftsmanship generally, design patterns and antipatterns, and more, but this guide will not say much more about it since only you know about your technical field. Moreover, you can likely find plenty of guidance on what you need to know.

You got to this point in your career likely because you have strong tech skills or at least strong enough that you can contribute at a high level in your enterprise as an individual contributor. What we are going to focus on in this guide, in your coaching relationship, and the Network overall, are the so-called soft skills of technical leadership, which are actually quite hard skills to develop.

## What Is Leadership?

Just like tech, leadership is a massive topic. A search on Amazon for books with the word leadership in their titles comes up with ___ hits. Some of the titles of the most popular books: *Leadership in Turbulent Times* (currently a best seller even though the author has zero leadership experience), *Leaders Eat Last* (Simon Sinek), *The 21 Irrefutable Laws of Leadership* (John C. Maxwell), *Dare to Lead* (Brene Brown), *The Dichotomy of Leadership* (Willink and Babin), *Start With Why* (Sinek again), *The 5 Levels of Leadership* (Maxwell again). Those titles are intermingled with other related topics like the *Seven Habits of Highly Effective People* (Covey) and *Emotional Intelligence 2.0* (Travis Bradberry). 

As big as Amazon's search result is, a Google's result set weighs in at over 4.1 billion (that's with a "b") hits. If there are 4.1 billion articles on leadership, then it is almost as if half of all the people on earth have posted something on the internet about leadership. Everyone seems to have an opinion on it.

For example, the [site MindTools](https://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/newLDR_41.htm) was somehow my first result, saying that "an effective leader" must do four things well: create a vision, motivate people to follow it, manage delivery of it, and coaching and build a team. Psychology Today [quotes Warren Bennis](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/leadership) who says, "leadership is the capacity to translate vision into reality" and that great leaders have "dazzling" social intelligence. [One](https://www.forbes.com/sites/kimberlyfries/2018/02/08/8-essential-qualities-that-define-great-leadership/#557f6b633b63) of Forbes's **many** leadership articles says that leaders must have eight qualities including "sincere enthusiasm" and charisma. Wikipedia has a [very long article on leadership](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leadership). And the New York Times recently ran [an opinion piece](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/24/opinion/sunday/not-leadership-material-good-the-world-needs-followers.html) that roughly says leadership is overrated and "hey, the world needs followers too." 

[Getting more into technology leadership, specifically, .... plug in some more tech specific leadership articles here]

Personally I tend to like John Maxwell's definition that leadership is simply followership, which is to say that you are a leader if people are following you. That seems very logical, simple, and actionable to me.

## What Should You Focus On?

Given that so much has been written and said about leadership, what are you supposed to do as a new tech lead? Who will you listen to? What guidance will you follow? Certainly almost all the points about effective leads have some validity to them. 

What we want to do at the Tech Lead Coaching Network is to drill in on very specific skills that will help you, as a first level, part-time leader in your organization, have the most impact and build a foundation for future growth as a leader in your career. 

In our [Coach's Guide](../coaches), we counsel our coaches to focus on a small set of practical skills that you can actually manage and that we think will have the most impact. Certainly leaders need to develop many skills and capabilities as they mature in their career, but we think the following are the "Pareto skills" for new tech leads.

If you have not heard it before, Vilfredo Pareto was an Italian economist who noticed that twenty percent of Italians owned eighty percent of the land. The Pareto principle was popularized as the 80/20 rule because it seems to hold in so many circumstances, such as the economics, sports, safety, crime, gambling, health care, and even software bug reports, according to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle). As you will see, we believe the Pareto principle holds for your tech leadership as well.

## The Five Pareto Skills

Following the Pareto prinicple just discussed, we believe the following five skills, if you work through them and grow in maturity within each of them, will make you an impactful tech lead. They won't be all the skills you need all the time, but these five will take you a long way down the road to being a great tech lead.

We ask our coaches to focus on:
1. Your ability to **listen** effectively to your team, your organizational network, and your management
2. The way that you **take initiative** to take action at work (in whatever context you are in)
3. How well and how often you **articulate a vision** for a given moment or given project
4. How you approach and execute the **tracking and adjusting** aspects of the tech lead role
5. Your own **growth mindset** as it pertains to yourself, your team, and your team's growth

### Listening

Being a great tech lead starts with great listening skills. Communication is said to be the hallmark of leadership, and communication has many aspects to it, including speaking and listening. But listening is the most important of the two components because it is through listening you get the raw data you need to take the right, most impactful actions. It is the foundation of your tech leadership.

You are not, however, a good listener or a bad listener -- despite what your significant other says. You are either more or less skillful at it and your skill probably varies a bit with the context. Still, you can think of your skill level on a continuum, where each level builds on the next. At the **beginner** level, tech leads will tend to focus principally on the content. It could be the facts, the data, the information coming from the sender. In our technical field, this content is obviously critically important to hear. Unfortunately, som tech leads fail to listen effectively even on this level, and there could be many reasons for it.

At the **intermediate** level, tech leads start to synthesize the content from the message with the context and the body language of the senders. Even in a highly technical field like ours, there is more to the message than the content and being able to read the non-verbal signals correctly within a given context is the mark of someone who is made a signficant growth in their ability to listen. 

Even at this level, however, your ability to fully hear the full message can impeded by your own needs, whether it is pressure from the project, your own insecurities, or your feelings about the sender will either block some aspects of the message or filter and twist the message. Thus, **advanced** listeners are able to put their own needs aside and absorb the full messsage empathically. This is a very hard level almost everyone to attain and sustain consistently so relax and work with your coach on it.

### Taking Initiative

This is normally thought of as a skill that we emphasize with senior individual contributors. It can be a very impactful skill to bring to your early leadership roles, however, because it is the skill and drive you need to step into as many of the right leadership moments as you can.

The way we evaluate this skill is more like a sliding scale than the stacking skillset that listening is. A **beginner** level of taking initiative for a tech lead generally means that the tech lead is reluctant to step into those leadership moments. There could be any number of valid reasons why a tech lead is reluctant to step into leadership moments and you coach may want to explore. 

An **intermediate** level of maturity with this skill may be exactly the reverse of the beginner level. At this level, you may find yourself jumping into many situations and volunteering your team to take initiative with ease. This is great because you could be making yourself visible as an emerging, high energy leader at your organization. At the intermediate level, however, the risk with taking too much initiative is that you could be stretching yourself and your team too thin and your outcomes may be uneven due, at least in part, to challenge of focusing your team on too many things at one. 

The **advanced** level, then, is the middle way between committing your team to taking on too much initiative and taking on too little. But the middle path is not about simply scaling back. It is about having the maturity and understanding of you and your team's capabilities and matching them up to only (but as many as you can) opportunities to have the most impact.

### Articulating a Vision

Speaking and articulating your point of view is the other key communication skill that we described in the first Pareto skill. But here, we focus primarily on how well you are synthesizing your understanding of the situation and then articulating a vision for how to proceed. You may create the vision on your own or you may cause it to emerge from your conversations with the team.

The word "vision" may evoke almost impossibly aspirational images in your mind of visionary leaders like John F. Kennedy, Jr., and his vision that America would be the first country to walk on the moon. For JFK, at his level of leadership, that made sense and it was something he could commit America to. 

By contrast, for you, at the first level of leadership in your organization, your vision may be so modest that it may hardly feel like a "vision" at all. It may simply seem like what needs to happen. But it takes vision nonetheless, and you would be suprised how many tech leads overlook this step.

For example, you may be in the middle of a database upgrade requiring some code changes and a new release. That may be "just work," but you have a vision for how it will go well: you need to make the cutover with as little downtime and, ideally, zero data loss or outages for users. How clearly are you stating what you want to happen? How often? This is what we are talking about in this section on "vision." It is practical and attainable, even for the newest tech leads.

At the **beginner** level you may struggle to be able to clearly articulate what you wants the team to do. At this level, you may know what needs to be done, you believe your team knows what needs to be done, and you believe that should be sufficient. Please do not worry if this is the level you are at because most of the tech leads I have worked with spend most of their time at this level. But you can grow into the **intermediate** level where, even if you think it is obvious to you, you are no able to clearly tell the team what needs to be done and why. The vision you tell the team is attainable and clear (like getting through the database upgrade described above) and the team can execute on it.

The **advanced** level of this is that you are able to articulate not only a clear vision but a compelling one. Maybe it is a little bigger, like you want the team to cut a release every week, but you are able to explain why the vision is compelling and how each team member contributes to the vision. Pretty high level stuff at this level, even for "routine" work.

### Tracking and Adjusting

One of the most likely tasks you do each day as a tech lead is to keep track of what the team is doing and/or making adjustments to their work. Like setting visions for small technical tasks, you may barely be concious of the tracking and adjusting work you are doing day in and day out.

At the **beginner** level we tell our coaches to pay particular attention to the extent to which you rely on technology, such as Github pull requests, Trello cards, Slack, and etc. to keep track of your team. This may seem like an odd area to have our coaches focus on because those tools give the impression that they are effecient, especially with remote teams. And for day to day communication, the tools may be completely fine. The risk we want our coaches to focus on is whether you are using the tools as a crutch to avoid difficult or challenging face to face conversations.

At the **intermediate** level you may be much more willing to engage in face to face conversations, but you may be reluctant to engage in some of those difficult conversations where you need to make changes in what an engineer is doing out of fear that the conversation could get confrontational. This level is a step up from the beginner level, however, so if you are making progress.

At the **advanced** level you are able to engage one on one on difficult issues with your team and able to do it in such a way that each team member feels valued and buys into the adjustment you are making. This is not an easy level to do consistently with many different people, so relax if you struggle with this. We all do -- even those most experienced leaders.

### Your Growth Mindset

This one is not so much a skill as it is a capability or mindset that you bring to the job. We do not ask our coaches to try to change this, since they are not therapists and your mindset was largely formed in the past, which is not a place your coaching conversations should be focused on.

However, we do want them to ask questions and challenge you on this point because if you believe, as we believe you *should* that you, your team, your management, your company, even your family members are not static in who they are. In the Tech Lead Coaching Network, we value personal growth, so your coach may ask you questions about where you stand on the topic because it helps them adjust their conversations with you. This is a complicated area, so you coach may struggle in this area a bit; be patient.

We tell our coaches that, as a tech lead, you are at the **beginner** level if you focus primarily on goals. The goals could come from your management or they could be goals you have articulated for yourself or your team. Goals are a good thing. They help to make things happen, so be relaxed that this is an impactful level.

The higher level, the **intermediate** level takes your impact to another level, however. By focusing on goals, you run the risk of putting the goal ahead of the needs of the individuals on the team and their capabilities to contribute to future goals. By shifting your focus to the process you and and your team follow to consistently reach goals, you will start operating at a much higher level. Your coach will be asking questions about this.

Once you reach the **advanced** level of this capability, it may be time for you to start considering being a coach in the Tech Lead Coaching Network yourself because at this level you are not only focusing on the process but you are likely building leaders within your own team.
