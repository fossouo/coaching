# The Seven Starter Sessions

We recommend the following structure for the first seven sessions. You are free to tailor the conversations based on what you are comfortable doing and saying, but we feel this should give both of you some confidence leaning on the structure of the conversation as you get started.

We offer tech leads the same guidance for the first seven conversations in the [Tech Lead's Guide](../tech-leads).

**Session One**: this should be a more in depth "get to know you" conversation than the **Introductory Call**. The call should have two halves to it:

* The first half of the conversation should be a bidirectional conversation about how you each got engaged with the Network, how you ended as a coach, and the tech lead's progression to the role. 
* The second half of the conversation should be an in depth conversation about what your tech's goals and challenges are.
At the end of this call, you should document what the goals are so that you can refer to them later. Keep these documents as safe and private as you would any human resources records.

**Sessions Two to Six**: the goal of these five sessions should be to get comfortable with the coaching relationship and to rely on the Tech Lead Coaching Network five skills as a framework to lean on as the two of you develop your relationship. The calls should roughly follow the following structure:

* start by reaffirming the tech lead's goals (3-5 minutes) and align on any adjustments
* ask the critical question: "how are you doing?" (5-15 minutes) and check in on the tech lead's goals set from the last call
* review the five Pareto skills and decide on which one to explore for this call, and then dive into it (~ 30 minutes)
* make a list of actions for your tech lead to work on until the next call (10-15 minutes)
* review whether structure of the call is working and what adjustments you each might want to make
* confirm schedule for the next call

**Session Seven**: this could be a short, relaxed check in call to confirm how the relationship is going and whether you and the tech lead want to continue. Future calls can continue the pattern set in sessions two to six, but by now you and your tech lead probably have something that's working for you that may differ from the structure proposed. If so, and it is working, then by all means continue. If not and you want to continue the relationship, this might be a good session to reset and review the structure to see how you might want to revise.
