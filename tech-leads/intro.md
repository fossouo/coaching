# Being a Tech Lead

> Leadership is influence - nothing more, nothing less. - John C. Maxwell

## What is a Tech Lead?

It may be helpful if we pause to explore the tech lead role a bit. Patrick Kua, the author of /Talking With Tech Leads/, is probably the best known writer and thinker on the tech lead role in software engineering. He offers a short definition:

> A Tech Lead is a software engineer, responsible for leading a development team, and responsible for the quality of its technical deliverables. [The Definition of a Tech Lead - patkua@work](https://www.thekua.com/atwork/2014/11/the-definition-of-a-tech-lead/)

**Our definition**: our definition and approach is a bit broader, I think simpler, and emphasizes discrete, individual skills over theories, principles, or definitions.

In other words, the tech lead role is not necessarily a formal one. You might be a data scientist, software architect, senior software engineer, a consultant, or even a relative newbie. Indeed, there may not be anyone calling you a “tech lead” even if that is how you may want to start thinking about your role.

Developing tech lead skills is something almost everyone needs to do at some point in their career.

## The Role is Fluid and Leadership is Simple

The need for leadership is not a constant demand. In other sections, we'll explore “leadership moments,” which can be fleeting and you need to learn to identify, but you may be an individual contributor and suddenly find yourself in a role to, say, lead a team on how fix a bug, being the point person for developing a complicated new feature with the rest of the team, or defining a new architectural approach where leadership and coordination skills are crucial to the team’s success. When the bug or decision is made, leaderships is no longer as important.

Put most simply, you only need leadership skills when you need people to follow you. The challenge for many tech leads is that they often receive very little support as they transition into the role. So developing those skills is what the Tech Lead Coaching Network is all about.

## Why Consider Coaching?

To explain the value of coaching for your tech leadership, let’s start with software engineering. Programming is a skill. You had to learn how to write code in a programming language. But you probably didn’t learn much about programming from taking a class, let alone how to be a professional software engineer, did you?

Software engineers constantly practice their skill by writing new code. They read other people’s code. The learn new skills and techniques from books, other software engineers, and sites like StackOverflow. And they improve over time.

Programmers also get quick feedback, which reinforces or corrects their skill. When it works they often seek further optimizations and when it does not they search for answers. These days, product teams often get pretty fast feedback from the market as well through techniques like A/B testing. These feedback loops are pretty fast.

Now contrast those fast feedback loops with leading people. When working with people, things take time. Sometimes you get negative feedback. Sometimes you get feedback when you didn’t want it. Sometimes you get no feedback at all. It is hard to know what worked and what did not.

Moreover, there are relatively few ways to Google your way to optimize or debug your tech leadership. While there are plenty of websites and forums where you may be able to go for some ideas, individuals are as unique and complicated their fingerprints. They get even more complex when they are part of a team.

Coaching is a way to get at least a bit of feedback as you grow your tech leadership skills. Just as programmers learn that there is nothing magical about code, there is similarly nothing magical about leadership. It is simply a set of behaviors and skills that need to be developed and practiced.

## What is Tech Lead Coaching?

*TODO*: add a summary of this section

In our view of tech lead coaching, it is a peer based relationship and series of conversations where you work with another tech lead to develop your leadership skills.

Before exploring it further, let us begin by explaining what tech lead coaching is not. First, it is not training. Tech leads who coach other tech leads do not need to be experts at the role nor do they need to be good at training.

It is also not some form of counseling or therapy. Coaching conversations should not explore the distant past in too much depth nor should they explore the faraway future. Put differently, relationship is not intended to be a series of extended conversations about where your life is going or how it got here.

Finally, and most importantly, coaching conversations are not intended to be sessions where a coach diagnoses and fixes problems for you.  Only the individual can do that for themselves. It is natural for coaches to want to dive into problems and for tech leads to ask for that kind of advice, but really, that is not the goal of tech lead coaching sessions.

Now let us explore what tech lead coaching should be. Tech lead coaching should start with a one to one relationship between two tech leads. The coach should have more experience in the role than the individual being coached, but it doesn’t need to be a substantially lot more experience. Some coaches are naturally good at it, and can draw on that skill as opposed to a large body of experience in the role.

The relationship should lead to a series of periodic conversations. The conversations can be in person, on the phone, or via a video conference service. The conversations can be as frequent as is convenient for the coach and the individual.

There should be some structure to each conversation and a process to the series of meetings. The structure and process is intended to make sure that the tech lead being coached walks away from each conversation with something actionable and that the overall series of conversations should lead to a progression of the tech lead’s skills. Of course, there should be considerable flexibility in the structure and process so that the coach and the tech lead can form a relationship, adapt to the moment, and not feel artificial or stilted.

Finally, the conversations should be focused on what’s happening in the immediate future. As mentioned above, the conversations aren’t meant to be a long rumination about the past or explorations of what the future could hold. Using the conversation structure above, it should focus on what’s happening in the tech lead’s immediate environment and project and specific steps that can be taken.

## What is the Tech Lead Coaching Network?

The Tech Lead Coaching network is the community based, open sourced, peer to peer network of tech leads who are seeking coaching or want to offer coaching. It is not a training program, nor is it online training, live training, or even a for profit enterprise.

The Network is an idea started by me after working at Red Hat, which is the leading open source enterprise software company. At Red Hat, I worked in the professional services group consulting with Red Hat clients to develop software with Red Hat technologies or implement them. During his time at Red Hat he was promoted to the equivalent of a field engineering manager where he had the opportunity to many and lead many teams at almost 100 Fortune 500 and government agencies, many of whom are household names.

In the process, it became clear to me how important team-level leadership is, not just for the field engineering teams I was deploying but at client sites as well. Technology, especially cutting edge technology, creates problems and issues to be sure, but the vast majority of the times that a project was highly successful it was either because of skilled client leadership or skilled leadership on the team. The roles and titles didn’t matter; solid communication and leadership skills made or broke a project every time.

Following the open source tradition, the Tech Lead Coaching Network is a peer to peer, open community where tech leads can grow their leadership skills.
