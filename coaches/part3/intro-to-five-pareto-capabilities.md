# The Five Pareto Skills
Following the Pareto theory just discussed, we believe the following five skills, if you work through them with your tech lead and help them grow their maturity within each of them, will produce strong results for their leadership and their organizations. 

Pause for a moment to reflect on that. If it's true, and you can positively grow one individual's capabilities in just five areas, then think about what a ripple effect that has on their organizations and all the people that your tech lead will touch in their career. What an amazing opportunity.

Of course, these five are not by any means all the skills a tech lead needs and surely some of your coaching conversations will deviate away from these topics, but we believe they are a great start and a great way to explore most day-to-day problems.

When in a coaching conversation, listen closely to your tech lead and note how effective they are with these skills:
1. The tech lead's ability to **listen** effectively to his or her team, organization, and management
2. How your tech lead **takes initiative** and ownership of the tasks or situations
3. Their effectiveness at **articulating a vision** for a project or situation
4. How you approach and execute the **tracking and adjusting** aspects of the tech lead role
5. Your own **growth mindset** as it pertains to yourself, your team, and your team's growth

Importantly, in Chapter Four we counsel you to focus your listening efforts on the tech lead's capabilities and not to try to dive in and solve their problems. Keeping the Tech Lead Coaching Model in front of you while talking with a tech lead will help you keep the focus where it needs to be.
