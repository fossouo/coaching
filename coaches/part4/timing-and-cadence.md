# How Often Should You Talk?

We recommend scheduling the first seven calls for a routine monthly cadence. 

Some coaching relationships may benefit from a much more rapid cadence, such as weely, and others may benefit from a rapid cadence in the benginning followed by much less frequent rate, such as quarterly.

Yet other relationships may call for only ad hoc, occaisional calls whenever a tech lead has problems or a coach wants to check in. 

Again, the choice is based on your bandwidth, the tech lead's bandwidth and needs, and how you negotiate those.

## How Long Should You Coach a Tech Lead For?

As long as you want! For some coaching relationships, you may not even make it through the Seven Starter Seessions. For others, you may go on for quite some time. The relationship is voluntary for both of you.
