# Getting Signed Up

Getting signed up is a fairly straight forward process and is similar to the process that tech leads follow when they want to sign up for coaching.

You start by applying on the [Tech Lead Coaching Network](https://techleadcoaching.com) community site. You will fill out some basic information.

Then a community organizer will reach out to you within a few days to schedule a **Discovery Call**. During this discovery call, which could be via the phone, in person, or via a video call, the organizer will have an informal conversation with you. Topics include:
* How you found the Tech Lead Coaching Network and what your expectations are
* Why you are interested in coaching
* What kinds of tech leads would you like to work with
* What your bandwidth is for taking on tech lead coachees and how much time and energy you are able to commit
* Ask you to start exploring your own thoughts about the impact you want to have as a coach

The organizer will then work up a short, one or two paragraph **Coach Profile** that he or she will send to you to confirm whether it is reflective of what you want to say. This is important because the Coach Profile will be shared with prospective tech leads during the matching process (see below).

Once your Coach Profile is complete, then there is not much more for you to do than wait for another contact from the organizer to connect you with a tech lead. (Well, you could contribute some improvements to these docs or consider running a workshop at your company if you really need something to do :-).)
