# Tech Lead Coaching

> "If you want to build a ship, don't start gathering up wood and assigning tasks to people; instead, teach them to long for the endless immensity of the sea."

The **Tech Lead Coaching Network** is a free, open source, community driven, and volunteer-based organization of tech leads and those who coach them. You are currently viewing the open source materials intended to guide new tech leads and coaches in what to expect, what skills to focus on, and generally how to get started.

These guides were originally written by Michael Rice (me@michaelrice.com)[mailto:me@michaelrice.com] but you are welcome to contribute to it on [Github](https://github.com/techleadworkshops/coaching).
