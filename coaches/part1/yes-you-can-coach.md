# Yes You -- Even YOU -- Can Coach

If you are interested in coaching, I wish I could sit right next to you right now and talk you through it because you are, in many ways, the most important part of the network. You are the heart and soul of the Tech Lead Coaching Network.

I also think I know something about you. That is, by the very fact of you reading this, I bet there is something wonderful about you that you want to give back to others and to be an impactful part of others' lives. That might be why you're a bit curious about this coaching thing, but you may be a little uncertain.

So this guide starts by addressing a feeling that most new coaches feel: **can I actually be a coach to other tech leads**? The short answer is you absolutely can. 

Read on, coach.
