# Chapter One: Being a Tech Lead

In this chapter, we explore the role of the tech lead and why coaching may help you grow your impact as a tech lead.

## What is a Tech Lead?

It may be helpful if we pause to explore the tech lead role a bit. Patrick Kua, the author of *Talking With Tech Leads*, is probably the best known writer and thinker on the tech lead role in software engineering. He offers a short definition:

> A Tech Lead is a software engineer, responsible for leading a development team, and responsible for the quality of its technical deliverables. [The Definition of a Tech Lead - patkua@work](https://www.thekua.com/atwork/2014/11/the-definition-of-a-tech-lead/)

**Our definition**: our definition and approach is a bit broader, I think simpler, and emphasizes discrete, individual skills over theories, principles, or definitions.  We define a tech lead as anyone in a technical field (such as, but not limited to, software engineering) who needs to influence his or her team to take a certain act or series of acts.

In other words, we take the perspective that the tech lead role is not necessarily a formal one. You might be a data scientist, software architect, senior software engineer, a consultant, or even a relative newbie. Indeed, there may not be anyone calling you a “tech lead” even if that is how you may want to start thinking about your role. Moreover, you may only be in a tech lead role momentarily. Your management may ask you to "take point," "drive," or lead a certain feature or project, and so you need to take on a tech lead role for only as long as that initiative takes to complete.

No matter whether you want to evolve your career into a leadership position or not, developing tech lead skills is something almost everyone in our fields needs to do at some point in their career.

## What Do Tech Leads Do?

The tech lead role in some companies is a formal designation with a clear job description. In other companies and contexts, the tech lead role is more ambiguous. 

In either case, some of the daily activities that tech leads participate in may include the following non-exhaustive list:

* teaming up with engineering management to be the interface between the technical team and other related functions, such as product management, quality assurance, project management, and etc.;
* architecting, designing, or driving buy in for key technical decisions;
* participating in feature design sessions;
* understanding, clarifying, and triaging bugs and tech debt;
* tracking what the technical team is doing at a deeper technical level than typical engineering management;
* clearly articulating the status of the work to the next level of management or other constituencies;
* making adjustments to the work that other individual contributors are doing; and
* much, much more.

## The Role is Fluid

Reading the list of day to day tasks should make clear that the need for tech lead activities is not a constant demand -- instead it can come go depending on the organization, the team, and state of the project. 

For example, you may be an individual contributor and unexpectedly find yourself in a moment where you need to, say, lead a team on how fix a bug, be the point person for developing a complicated new feature with the rest of the team, or define a new architectural approach where leadership and coordination skills are crucial to the project's success. When the bug or decision is made, the need for your leadership declines. (In later chapters, we will explore more of these "leadership moments," which can be fleeting and you should learn to identify.)

Put differently, you only need to think about being a lead all the time, since most of your day will likely continue to be spent deep in whatever technology stack your team uses. 

You only need leadership skills when you need to influence people to follow you. 

The challenge for many tech leads is that they typically receive very little support as they transition into the role. Developing those skills is what the Tech Lead Coaching Network is all about.

## Why Consider Coaching?

To explain the value of coaching for your tech leadership, let us start with a process that may be familiar: programming. Programming is a skill. To be a programmer, you have to learn the nuances of a programming language. Maybe you took classes on the subject. Maybe you are self taught. But learning to write code and get it to compile and perform correctly is a well travelled journey you can go on.

The journey never really ends, however, because good programmers continue to invest in their craft. They try new ways of writing new code. They read other people's code. They learn new skills and techniques from books, other software engineers, and sites like Stackoverflow. And they improve over time. Between the compiler's feedback, the unit tests' results, and the internet, the feedback loop for programmers is pretty fast these days. 

Now contrast those fast feedback loops with leading people. When working with people, things take time. Sometimes you get negative feedback. Sometimes you get feedback when you didn't want it. Sometimes you get no feedback at all. It is hard to know what worked and what did not.

Moreover, there are relatively few ways to Google your way to optimize or debug your tech leadership. While there are plenty of websites and forums where you may be able to go for some ideas, individuals are as unique and complicated as their fingerprints. They get even more complex when they are part of a team.

Coaching is a way to get at least a bit of feedback as you grow your tech leadership skills. Just as programmers learn that there is nothing magical about code, there is similarly nothing magical about leadership. It is simply a set of behaviors and skills that need to be developed and practiced.

## What is Tech Lead Coaching?

In our view of tech lead coaching, at least in our community, is a peer based relationship and series of conversations where you work with another tech lead to develop your leadership skills.

Before exploring it further, let us begin by explaining what tech lead coaching is not. First, it is not training. Tech leads who coach other tech leads do not need to be experts at the role nor do they need to be good at training.

It is also not some form of counseling or therapy. Coaching conversations should not explore the distant past in too much depth nor should they explore the faraway future. Put differently, relationship is not intended to be a series of extended conversations about where your life is going or how it got here.

Finally, and most importantly, coaching conversations are not intended to be sessions where a coach diagnoses and fixes problems for you.  Only you can do that for themselves. It is natural for coaches to want to dive into problems and for tech leads to ask for that kind of advice, but really, that is not the goal of tech lead coaching sessions.

Now let us explore what tech lead coaching should be. Tech lead coaching should start with a one to one relationship between two tech leads. The coach should have more experience in the role than the individual being coached, but it doesn’t need to be a substantially lot more experience. Some coaches are already good at it, and can draw on existing coaching skill as opposed to a large body of experience in the role.

The relationship should lead to a series of periodic conversations. The conversations can be in person, on the phone, or via a video conference service. The conversations can be as frequent as is convenient for you and your coach.

There should be some structure to each conversation and a process to the series of meetings. The structure and process is intended to make sure that you walk away from each conversation with something actionable and that the overall series of conversations should help you tech lead skills and confidence grow. 

Of course, there should also be considerable flexibility in the structure and process so that the coach and the tech lead can form a relationship, adapt to the moment, and not feel artificial or stilted.

Finally, the conversations should be focused on what’s happening in the immediate future. As mentioned above, the conversations are not meant to be a long rumination about the past or explorations of what the future could hold. Using the conversation structure above, it should focus on what’s happening in you immediate environment and project and specific steps that can be taken.

## Where Did the Tech Lead Coaching Network Come From?

The Tech Lead Coaching network is an idea started by me, this guide's author, out of my experience working at Red Hat around 2016. At Red Hat, I worked in the professional services group consulting with Red Hat clients to develop software with the company's technologies or implement them. During my time at the company, I was promoted to the equivalent of a field engineering manager where I had the opportunity to many and lead many teams at almost 100 Fortune 500 and government agencies, many of whom are household names.

In the process, it became clear to me how important team-level leadership is, not just for the field engineering teams I was deploying but at client sites as well. Technology, especially cutting edge technology, creates its own problems and issues to be sure, but the vast majority of the times that a project was highly successful it was either because of skilled client leadership or skilled leadership on the team. The roles and titles didn't matter at all; solid communication and leadership skills made or broke a project every time.

Following that open source tradition, the Tech Lead Coaching Network is a peer to peer, open community where tech leads can grow their leadership skills.
