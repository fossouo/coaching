# What Coaching IS 

The images just described share a common theme: the coaches either know more than their coachees or they're directing them to take certain actions. 

In that model, the coach has superior information and/or is supposed to solve problems for their coachees.

This is **not** the kind of coaching we do at the Tech Lead Coaching Network.

Indeed, as a Network coach, we specifically ask that **you to not give any advice** and, most importantly, **do not try to solve your tech lead's problems**.

Remember that you and your tech lead are peers. You may have a few more years' experience, but remember your tech lead is the only one who can solve his or her problems. 

**Your role as a coach is listen closely, ask questions, and generally support, counsel, and affirm your tech lead's options and choices.**

Most tech leads who are considering taking that next step to be a coach in the Network, even those without many years of experience as a tech lead, are capable of listening and asking questions. 

Hopefully changing your mindset from one who directs to one who listens and affirms makes you feel confident that this is something you can successfully do -- if you commit to it.
