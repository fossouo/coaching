# Skill 2/2 - Your Tech Lead Experience

The second skill you need is that you do must have some experience under your belt as a tech lead before signing up as a coach. 

As the Tech Lead Coaching Network grows, its strength will be in the community and in the shared experiences we bring to it. You cannot give those experiences if you don't have them.

If you were reading carefully, however, you may be wondering why I am emphasizing your experience when I just got done telling you that we do not want you offering advice or trying to solve your tech lead's problems. 

If we do not want you giving advice or diving in to solve problems, then why do coaches need any experience at all? It seems like anyone can just *listen*. 

To be an effective, empathic listener, however, your experience as a tech lead is precisely what you need to bring to the coaching conversation.

First, your tech lead may not feel comfortable seeking coaching from someone who has not walked where he or she is going. Having that shared, peer experience creates a lot of instant connection and likely speeds up the time it takes to build trust between the two of you.

Second, you are not going to be an effective listener if you do not really understand the tech lead's context and experiences. This makes it easier for you to listen with empathy because you have probably been in similar situations or, more importantly, could easily imagine being in them.

Finally, tapping into your experiences as a tech lead yourself makes it easier for you to ask effective questions. Some of those questions may be ways to guide or provide some direction (especially when using the model). Most of communication is unsaid, and your experiences as a tech lead help fill in the blanks.
